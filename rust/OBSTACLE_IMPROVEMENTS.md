# Obstacle Resolution Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified
You correctly identified that the CFD simulation had poor obstacle representation due to:
1. **Too coarse grid resolution** relative to obstacle size
2. **Poor boundary condition enforcement** around curved surfaces
3. **Unrealistic flow patterns** with fluid "leaking" around obstacles

## âœ… Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Grid Resolution Enhancement**
- **Scene 1 (Wind Tunnel)**: Increased from 120Ã—120 to 200Ã—200 grid
- **Better obstacle representation**: Each obstacle now spans multiple grid cells
- **Improved accuracy**: Better resolution of curved boundaries

### 2. **Obstacle Sizing Optimization**
- **Circle radius**: Now spans 8 grid cells (was ~1-2 cells)
- **Airfoil chord**: Now spans 20 grid cells for proper flow development
- **Dynamic sizing**: Obstacles scale with grid resolution automatically

### 3. **Better Positioning**
- **Circle**: Positioned at 25% downstream for upstream flow development
- **Airfoil**: Positioned at 65% downstream to interact with circle wake
- **Vertical separation**: Circle at 40% height, airfoil at 60% for interaction study

### 4. **Enhanced Boundary Conditions**
- **Two-pass algorithm**: First marks solid cells, then enforces velocities
- **Face-centered velocity enforcement**: Proper no-slip on velocity faces
- **Neighbor checking**: Ensures velocity is zero at fluid-solid interfaces

### 5. **Solver Improvements**
- **Increased iterations**: 40 iterations for Scene 1 (vs 30) for better convergence
- **Maintained performance**: Still optimized for other scenes

## ðŸ“Š Expected Improvements

### Better Flow Physics:
- **No more "leaking"**: Fluid properly flows around obstacles
- **Realistic wake formation**: Proper vortex shedding behind circle
- **Airfoil interaction**: Accurate interaction with upstream wake
- **Sharp boundaries**: Clean separation at obstacle surfaces

### Visual Quality:
- **Smooth streamlines**: No unrealistic jumps or gaps
- **Proper smoke behavior**: Tracer particles follow realistic paths
- **Wake visualization**: Clear wake patterns behind both obstacles
- **Pressure field accuracy**: Correct high/low pressure regions

## ðŸŽ® Testing the Improvements

```bash
# Test the improved obstacle simulation
cargo run --release -- --scene 1 --steps 200 --output improved_obstacles

# Compare with previous version:
# - Circle should show proper wake formation
# - Airfoil should interact with circle wake
# - Smoke should flow smoothly around both obstacles
# - No unrealistic "straight line" paths through obstacles
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Grid Resolution Details

### New Configuration:
- **Grid**: 200Ã—200 cells (40,000 total)
- **Domain**: ~1.78Ã—1.0m (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Grid spacing**: ~0.005m
- **Circle diameter**: ~0.08m (16 cells across)
- **Airfoil chord**: ~0.1m (20 cells)

### Key Ratios:
- **Circle**: 8 cells radius = 16 cells diameter
- **Airfoil**: 20 cells chord length
- **Minimum feature size**: 4-5 cells (ensures proper resolution)

This ensures proper representation of:
- Curved boundaries
- Wake formation
- Pressure gradients
- Viscous effects near walls
